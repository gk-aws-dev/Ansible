## Introduction:

- Ansible provides open-source automation that reduces complexity and runs everywhere. Using Ansible lets you automate virtually any task.
- Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and orchestration. It simplifies complex IT tasks by allowing users to automate repetitive tasks without requiring extensive knowledge of programming or scripting languages
- Ansible uses simple, human-readable scripts called playbooks to automate your tasks. You declare the desired state of a local or remote system in your playbook. Ansible ensures that the system remains in that state

**As automation technology, Ansible is designed around the following principles:**

- Agent-less architecture
Low maintenance overhead by avoiding the installation of additional software across IT infrastructure.

- Simplicity
Automation playbooks use straightforward YAML syntax for code that reads like documentation. Ansible is also decentralized, using SSH existing OS credentials to access to remote machines.

- Scalability and flexibility
Easily and quickly scale the systems you automate through a modular design that supports a large range of operating systems, cloud platforms, and network devices.

- Idempotence and predictability
When the system is in the state your playbook describes Ansible does not change anything, even if the playbook runs multiple times.
