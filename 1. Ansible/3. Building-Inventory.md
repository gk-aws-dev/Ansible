## Building Inventory

- Inventories organize managed nodes in centralized files that provide Ansible with system information and network locations. Using an inventory file, Ansible can manage a large number of hosts with a single command.
- We have to install the Ansible on the single host/machine then we can manage the all other host with host file through ansible. You must also ensure that your public SSH key is added to the authorized_keys file on each host.

## Passwordless SSH auhentication:
- step:1 - create public and private key on ansible server with the help of the command: ```ssh-keygen```
- step:2 - copy the keys to the node/hosts - ```ssh-copy-id ansible@<ip-address-for-hosts```
- After above command we can see the public keys has been added in the ```authorized_keys``` file in the hosts server.
- now we can do the password less authentication from ansible server to the all hosts server.

## Continue getting started with Ansible and build an inventory as follows:

- Create a file named ```inventory.ini``` in the ansible_quickstart directory that you created in the preceding step.

- Add a new [myhosts] group to the inventory.ini file and specify the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of each host system.

```
[myhosts]
192.0.2.50
192.0.2.51
192.0.2.52
```

Verify your inventory.

```ansible-inventory -i inventory.ini --list```

- Ping the myhosts group in your inventory. - ```ansible myhosts -m ping -i inventory.ini```

## also we can add the host in the /etc/ansible/hosts file as well in the server. for that we have to uncomment few lines in the /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file as below.
