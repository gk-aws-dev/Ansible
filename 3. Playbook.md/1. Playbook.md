## Ansible Playbook:

- If you need to execute a task with Ansible more than once, write a playbook and put it under source control. Playbooks are expressed in ```YAML``` format. for eg. ```example.yaml```
- Ansible Playbooks offer a repeatable, reusable, simple configuration management and multi-machine deployment system, one that is well suited to deploying complex applications.

## Patterns: targeting hosts and groups:

- When you execute Ansible through an ad hoc command or by running a playbook, you must choose which managed nodes or groups you want to execute against. Patterns let you run commands and playbooks against specific hosts and/or groups in your inventory.
- An Ansible pattern can refer to a single host, an IP address, an inventory group, a set of groups, or all hosts in your inventory. Patterns are highly flexible - you can exclude or require subsets of hosts, use wildcards or regular expressions, and more. Ansible executes on all inventory hosts included in the pattern.

- For eg.
```
- name: restart webservers
  hosts: webservers
```

## Playbook Execution:

- A playbook runs in order from top to bottom. Within each play, tasks also run in order from top to bottom. 
- Playbooks with multiple ‘plays’ can orchestrate multi-machine deployments, running one play on your webservers, then another play on your database servers, then a third play on your network infrastructure, and so on. At a minimum, each play defines two things:

•	the managed nodes to target, using a pattern.
•	at least one task to execute.

- we can use below command to run the ansible-playbook
```
- ansible-playbook test.yaml
- ansible-playbook test.yaml --check
```
