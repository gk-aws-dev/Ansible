## Module:

- Modules (also referred to as “task plugins” or “library plugins”) are discrete units of code that can be used from the command line or in a playbook task. Ansible executes each module, usually on the remote target node, and collects return values.
- Each module supports taking arguments. Nearly all modules take ```key=value``` arguments, space delimited. Some modules take no arguments, and the command/shell modules simply take the string of the command you want to run.

```ansible-doc -l``` –> to check all modules.

```ansible-doc yum``` -> to check the information about the specific module. We have lots of the module present in the ansible. Some of them are as below-

```
yum
service
copy
get-url – for wget.
user – to make user.
state – present-to install, absent- to uninstall or remove, latest- update.
pkg
```

## you can execute the modules from command line as well.

```
ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"  # to start the services
ansible webservers -m ping    
ansible webservers -m command -a "/sbin/reboot -t now"   # to reboot
ansible dev -b -m copy -a ‘src=/etc/ansible/hosts dest=/var/www/html’  # to copy the files
ansible all -m user -a "name=foo password=<crypted password here>"  # to create the user

```
