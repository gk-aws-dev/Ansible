## Module:

- Modules (also referred to as “task plugins” or “library plugins”) are discrete units of code that can be used from the command line or in a playbook task. Ansible executes each module, usually on the remote target node, and collects return values.
- Each module supports taking arguments. Nearly all modules take ```key=value``` arguments, space delimited. Some modules take no arguments, and the command/shell modules simply take the string of the command you want to run.
